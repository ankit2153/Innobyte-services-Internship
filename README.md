# About User API project

## Login with OTP (One-Time Password):
  - Users can log in using their email address.
  - Instead of a traditional password, they receive a one-time code on their email.
  - This code is used to authenticate them securely.

## Login with Password:
  - Users can also log in using a password.
  - Their passwords are stored securely in a MongoDB database.
  - To keep the passwords safe, a technique called bcrypt is used, which scrambles them so they can't be easily read.

## Signup:
  - New users can create accounts through a signup process.
  - Their details, like email and password, are stored securely in MongoDB.

## User Dashboard:
  - Once logged in, users have access to their own dashboard.
  - This dashboard might show personalized information or features based on their account.

## Technology Used:
  - React JS: A framework for building user interfaces.
  - EmailJS: Service used for sending emails securely.
  - MongoDB: A type of database used to store user information.
  - Bcrypt: A method used to secure passwords before storing them in the database.


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
